  a user can input a non-empty string and all characters which are not letters will be removed

      'abc' -> 'abc'
      'heLLO' -> 'heLLO'
    only not-letters:

      '-=>|<=-' -> ''
      '. - ^ - .' -> ''
    mixed letters and not-letters:
      'hello world!' -> 'helloworld'
      'let input = ""' -> 'letinput'

      - use full sentences and correct JS vocabulary
    [ ] the program runs
    [ ] the program has no errors
